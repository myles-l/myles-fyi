In 2019, I started work on a new brand for Signal Messenger. Coincidentally, as the work progressed on the brand, media coverage of Signal Messenger increased significatly and it became clear that a modest rebrand (as opposed to a whole rethink) was the right move. 

We settled on an update to the logo and color scheme, to help Signal appear more contemporary and appealing to mainstream users, without alienating the existing userbase.
