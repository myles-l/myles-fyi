Baldessari began as a more traditional painter. By the end of the 1960s, he was shifting from semi-abstract paintings into more conceptual work. In the summer of 1970, he declared this departure with an act of extreme destruction. He brought together all the paintings still in his possession that dated from May 1953—the month he graduated from college—to March 1966. He made some slides of the works, numbering around 100, before they were broken into pieces and hauled to a San Diego mortuary, where they were cremated. The ritualistic act was later titled the “Cremation Project.”

Baldessari had begun his career in the 1950s by sticking to tradition. He was in his twenties, and he was still figuring out who he was as an artist and, most importantly, who he wanted to be. The result was an inventory of relatively traditional semi-abstract paintings.

Rather than doing what most artists do and simply storing them away, he gathered them up, took them to a crematorium in nearby San Diego, and had the entire lot destroyed.

The ashes filled 10 large boxes - some of which were stored in a book-shaped urn, engraved with his name, which then lived on his bookshelf for the rest of his life. Baldessari combined some of the other ashes with cookie dough, and the resulting cookies were exhibited at New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).

"To be creative you have to have destruction quite often too," Baldessari would tell an interviewer years later. "It's like the idea of a phoenix rising from the ashes."

In honour of the old artworks, he placed a death notice in a local newspaper.

Just a year later, he declared to the world: “[I will not make any more boring art](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/59546).”
